# Wake-SPRK
Inspired by previous work to utilize a stewart platform design using [RSS links][1], this project provides a method to simulate motion to be used with a surgical robotic system.
The features of this project include:
* OpenGL visualization tool (pyqtgraph module)
* Motor communication with Dynamixel controller (specific motors used XM430-W210)
* (WIP) Optional ROS interface with command and read topics including TF information

## Examples
TODO 

## Dependencies
* Python 3 (recommend anaconda for common modules, conda environments, and spyder ide)
* pyqtgraph for fast visualization (depricated matplotlib viewer is given, but has poor performance)
* dynamixel sdk (generic driver installation might need to be included)

## Getting Started
